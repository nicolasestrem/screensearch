## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Local inference could be permanently unavailable on a rate-limited network.** The app
  resolves its llama.cpp sidecar through GitHub's *anonymous* releases API, which is capped at
  60 requests/hour per IP. On a shared address the quota can be exhausted, and a single `403`
  left the app with no `llama-server` for the whole session — search still worked, but vision
  tagging and Ask never did. Resolution now falls back to a pinned, SHA-256-verified Windows
  Vulkan release asset (downloaded from GitHub's release-asset host, which is not subject to the
  API quota); a working API still picks the newest build, and `SSV2C_LLAMA_RELEASE_URL` still
  overrides both. The binary download itself gets up to three attempts on transient
  `401`/`403`/`408`/`429`/`5xx` and transport errors, and the failure message now carries the
  full error chain instead of only the outer context.
