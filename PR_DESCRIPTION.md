# 🚀 ScreenSearch V2: Intelligence, Rebranding, and Core Evolution

## 🌟 Summary
This PR marks a significant milestone in the evolution of the application, officially rebranding it as **ScreenSearch**. It introduces a powerful local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline, a "Intelligence" dashboard for AI-generated insights, and a completely overhauled UI architecture.  Backend systems have been refactored for modularity, introducing a dedicated worker system for embeddings and vector search operations.

## ✨ Key Features & Improvements

### 🧠 Intelligence & RAG Engine
- **Local Embedding Generation**: Integrated `screensearch-embeddings` crate to handle local vector embedding generation for captured frames.
- **Vector Search Support**: Added `vector_search` capabilities to `screensearch-db` to enable semantic search queries.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Implemented a full Retrieval-Augmented Generation flow, allowing the LLM to contextually answer questions based on user's screen history.
- **Intelligence Dashboard**: New UI tab dedicated to generating and viewing AI reports (Daily Summaries, Productivity Analysis, etc.).

### 🎨 Rebranding & UI/UX Polish
- **Project Renaming**: Replaced all user-facing instances of "Screen Memory" with **ScreenSearch**.
- **Visual Overhaul**:
  - **New Footer**: Added a cemented footer with author credits and project links.
  - **Dynamic Sidebar**: Improved navigation structure.
  - **Refined Typography**: Standardized font usage and spacing across the interface.
- **Enhanced Components**:
  - `Timeline`: Smoother interactions and better date handling.
  - `SettingsPanel`: Reorganized for better discoverability of new RAG settings.

### ⚡ Backend Architecture
- **Worker System**: Introduced `screensearch-api/src/workers` to handle heavy background tasks (embeddings, cleanup) without blocking the main thread.
- **Database Migrations**: New migrations to support vector storage and optimized indexing.
- **Code Quality**: Applied `cargo clippy` suggestions across the board, fixing 100+ linting issues, improving type safety and removing unused code.

## 🔧 Addresses Review Feedback
- **Safety**: Removed unsafe `Send`/`Sync` implementations in `EmbeddingEngine`, replaced with proper thread-safe design patterns preventing potential data races.
- **Stability**: Fixed potential panics in vector search blob processing; added robust error handling for malformed embedding data.
- **Performance**: Added large-dataset warnings for in-memory vector indexing and optimized SQL query construction to handle dynamic batch sizes safely.
- **Polish**: Fixed broken repository links in the footer and resolved test suite configuration issues.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### 📂 File Structure Changes
- **New Crates/Modules**:
  - `screensearch-embeddings/`: Dedicated crate for ML model interactions.
  - `screensearch-api/src/handlers/rag_helpers.rs`: RAG logic abstraction.
  - `screensearch-ui/src/components/Footer.tsx`: Branding and links.
- **Configuration**:
  - Updates to `Cargo.toml` to manage new workspace members and dependencies.

### 🔍 Verification
- **Functional**: Verified RAG pipeline generates embeddings and returns semantic results.
- **Visual**: Checked all pages for consistent "ScreenSearch" branding and layout integrity.
- **Performance**: Validated that background embedding generation does not degrade UI responsiveness.
